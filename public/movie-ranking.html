  <h1>The Best Movies According to Masaki</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Godzilla Minus One</h3>
  <p>This made Godzilla terrifying and had a good character story.</p>
  <h3>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</h3>
  <p>I was absolutely obsessed with this movie as a kid. I even tried to make my own grail diary.</p>
  <h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)</h3>
  <p>I loved the TMNT growing up and I still do. This movie was formative for me.</p>
