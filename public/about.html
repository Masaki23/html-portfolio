<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Masaki and I have studied web development since people thought ActionScript was going to be a huge thing! I recently got back into Web Development and hope to create some awesome projects on my own.</p>

<p>My main goal is to see how I can use HTML5 and other components to create games strictly played through a website.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions please email me!</p>
